This is my solution representation to task 1a. 

A large ship carries a lot of freight from an international hub further down on the continent, and delivers this at the shipping company's hub in Norway. The hub is centrally placed in the middle of the larger cities, and these cities are connected to the hub through smaller feeder ship which travel at greater speed than the large ships, while having lower capacity. 

Freight destined for the ports 1, 2, 3 and 4 are loaded into one smaller ship at port 5, which is the hub. Another feeder ship is loaded up with freight destined for the ports 6, 7 and 8. When loaded, the smaller ships travel to their destinations, drop off some freight, load up with freight for another destination and travels further along its route. 





### Assumptions:

- Large ships are expensive to operate, need to be filled up to be economically healthy
- Smaller ships are faster, more economically and easier to "legge til havn"
-
