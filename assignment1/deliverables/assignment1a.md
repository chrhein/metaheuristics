This is my solution representation to task 1a. A large ship carries a lot of freight from an international hub further down on the continent, and delivers this at the shipping company's hub in Norway. The hub is centrally placed in the middle of the larger cities, and these cities are connected to the hub through smaller feeder ship which travel at greater speed than the large ships, while having lower capacity. Freight destined for the ports 1, 2, 3 and 4 are loaded into one smaller ship at the hub, and another feeder ship is loaded up with freight destined for the ports 6, 7 and 8.
